## Code Style Guidelines

Use these guidelines to ensure consistency through out the code:
- Ensure indents are done using a single tab, not spaces.
- Use readable function and variable names.
- For Rust, run `cargo fmt` to ensure consistent formatting.

Additionally, ensure that your code passes all tests before submitting a PR.

## Review Process

Once you submit a pull request, a project maintainer will review it. Please be patient, as this can take a few days. If changes are requested, update your pull request with the requested modifications.

Once the pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities and Important Bugs

If you encounter a security vulnerability, **please do not submit it as a public issue**. Instead, report it privately by making a ticket in our Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/vant7wH5wx).

For other critical bugs that are not related to security but impact functionality, you can open an issue on GitHub with as much detail as possible. When reporting, please include:
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- The expected behavior
- The actual behavior
- Your environment details (operating system, Rust version, etc.)
